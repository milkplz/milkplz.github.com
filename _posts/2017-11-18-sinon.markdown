* <span style="color:red">Mocks,</span> which make replacing whole objects easier by combining both spies and stubs
In addition, Sinon also provides some other helpers, although these are outside the scope of this article:

* <span style="color:red">Fake XMLHttpRequest and server,</span> which can be used to fake Ajax requests and responses
